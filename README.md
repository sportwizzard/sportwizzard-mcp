# SportWizzard MCP Server

Query live sports-betting data — **odds, player props, +EV edges, arbitrage, stats and reference data** from 35+ sportsbooks and DFS apps — from any MCP-capable AI agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor, …).

20 read-only tools over the [SportWizzard REST v1 API](https://sportwizzard.com/developers), available two ways: a **hosted remote server** (zero install) and a **stdio server** via `npx`. Get a free API key at <https://sportwizzard.com/account> (API Keys tab — no card required).

## Hosted (recommended — zero install)

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http sportwizzard https://mcp.sportwizzard.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer sw_live_your_api_key_here"
```

```bash
codex mcp add sportwizzard --transport http --url https://mcp.sportwizzard.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer sw_live_your_api_key_here"
```

The hosted server is a thin proxy: your key is forwarded to the SportWizzard API, which enforces auth and rate limits. All 20 tools work on both transports. (`download_snapshot` on the hosted server returns a CDN download URL + a ready-to-run command your agent executes locally; on stdio it writes the file directly.)

Successful authenticated live tool calls send a best-effort account-usage
receipt. The measurement request contains no tool arguments or result data.
For hosted `download_snapshot`, a successful CDN HEAD check counts because
the tool has verified that the returned download URL is reachable; a failed
HEAD check does not count.

## Stdio (local)

```bash
npx -y sportwizzard-mcp
```

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add sportwizzard -e SPORTWIZZARD_API_KEY=sw_live_your_api_key_here -- npx -y sportwizzard-mcp
```

Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json` — macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`, Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sportwizzard": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "sportwizzard-mcp"],
      "env": { "SPORTWIZZARD_API_KEY": "sw_live_your_api_key_here" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mock mode (no key, no network)

Set `SPORTWIZZARD_MOCK=1` to get canned sample responses — useful for wiring up an integration before you have a key.

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SPORTWIZZARD_API_KEY` | _(none)_ | Your API key, sent as `X-Api-Key`. |
| `SPORTWIZZARD_BASE_URL` | `https://api.sportwizzard.com` | Override the API base URL. |
| `SPORTWIZZARD_MOCK` | _(off)_ | `1` = canned sample data, no network. |

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_events` / `get_event` | Events/fixtures — filter by league, team, status, time; full detail incl. weather, lineups, probable pitchers. |
| `get_event_stats` | Box score: every player's stat line + team results for one event. |
| `get_odds` / `get_event_odds` / `get_player_odds` / `get_team_odds` | Current prices, scoped by event, player, team, sportsbook, market, or league. `get_odds` also takes `scope`: `event` (game markets), `season` (season-long futures), `tournament` (golf/tennis outrights); omit for all. |
| `get_edges` | +EV edges vs. devigged fair market (league, source, min_edge filters). |
| `get_arbitrage` | Arbitrage opportunities with legs and stake fractions (two/three-way). |
| `list_players` / `list_teams` / `get_player_stats` / `get_team_stats` | Reference data and season/historical stats. |
| `get_player_game_logs` | Bulk per-game stat rows — the model-training feed. |
| `download_snapshot` | Save the full live board to disk (tens of MB gzip). `include_history: true` also populates every selection's `priceHistory` (same schema; 5 credits flat vs 1). |
| `list_sportsbooks` / `list_leagues` / `list_markets` / `status` | Discover source IDs, covered leagues and supported market types; check customer API availability. |
| `get_account_usage` | Your plan tier, rate limit, and monthly usage. |

Every response uses the envelope `{ success, data, nextCursor, meta }`; when `nextCursor` is present the tool appends a `_paging` hint so agents know to continue.

### Futures (season-scope markets)

`get_odds` with `scope=season` returns season-long futures — division/conference/championship winners, award odds, team win totals, season leaders and full-season player props. Three orthogonal axes describe them:

- **`marketScope`** — which anchor the market hangs off: `SEASON` or `TOURNAMENT`. Omitted entirely on ordinary game rows.
- **`period`** — the window within that anchor: `REG_SEASON` (settles at the end of the regular season) or `FULL` (runs through the playoffs).
- **`segment`** — which slice of the competition: `AFC_EAST`, `NL`, `SEC`, … Present only when the market is segment-scoped, and load-bearing: all 32 NFL `DIVISION_WINNER` selections share **one** season-anchor `eventId`, so without `segment` they read as a single 32-team race instead of 8 divisions.

Notes: winner/award markets are categorical (one `YES` selection per competitor, `teamSide: "NONE"`, usually no NO side); `eventStartTime` on a futures row is the season anchor / settlement date, **not** a kickoff; every book's futures for a competition share the same season `eventId`; and futures are deliberately excluded from `get_edges` / `get_arbitrage` (they never enter de-vig or edge math). Scope matching is exact — `season` does not include `TOURNAMENT` — and an invalid value returns HTTP 400 naming the valid ones.
